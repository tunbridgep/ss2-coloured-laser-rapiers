Making new rapiers is a somewhat straightforward process, but requires some tinkering with files and with the squirrel code. This requires care and attention to detail.

Follow these steps to make a new rapier. For this example, we will make an aquamarine coloured rapier. All rapiers have a 2 letter colour code, so we will use AQ. Red uses RD:

1. Create a new RAP_HP_AQ.GIF image in the Mesh/Txt16 folder, based on one of the existing ones, the file name must be exactly 8 characters in length. Edit it to give it the right colours.
2. Make a copy of RAPIER_H_RD.BIN and RAPIER_H_RD.CAL (or any other pairs of colour files) inside the Meshes folder, call them RAPIER_H_AQ.BIN and RAPIER_H_AQ.CAL
3. Open up the new .BIN file you created in a text editor
4. Replace all instances of RAP_H_RD.GIF with RAP_H_AQ.GIF. It is critically important that NO other parts of the file be edited. Changing even a single character will corrupt the model
5. In the Obj folder, make a copy of RAPIER_W_RD.BIN called RAPIER_W_AQ.BIN
5. In the Obj/Txt16 folder, make a copy of RED1.PCX and RED2.PCX. call them AQA1.PCX and AQA2.PCX. These file names must be exactly 4 characters in length.
6. Open up the new RAPIER_W_AQ.BIN file you created in a text editor
4. Replace all instances of RED1.PCX with AQA1.PCX, and all instances of RED2.PCX with AQA2.PCX. It is critically important that NO other parts of the file be edited. Changing even a single character will corrupt the model
5. Create a new file Icn_es_aq.pcx inside the ObjIcon folder, based on one of the existing files.
6. Open up sq_scripts/sargeLaserRapiers.nut
7. Find the colour set line. It should look similar to "local colour = Data.RandInt(0, 7);". Add 1 to the final digit, so it should now be "local colour = Data.RandInt(0, 8);" or similar.
8. Add a new block for the new colour. Find the last colour block before the else block. It should look something like this (the colour may be different and the number may be higher):

else if (colour == 6) //white
{
	SetupSword(150,0.0,0.0);
	SetupSwordModel("rapier_w_wh","rapier_h_wh","icn_es_wh");
}

Duplicate that block immediately below it, so it should look like this

else if (colour == 6) //white
{
	SetupSword(150,0.0,0.0);
	SetupSwordModel("rapier_w_wh","rapier_h_wh","icn_es_wh");
}
else if (colour == 6) //white
{
	SetupSword(150,0.0,0.0);
	SetupSwordModel("rapier_w_wh","rapier_h_wh","icn_es_wh");
}

Then, change the index number from 6 to 7 (or, if another number, one higher than the existing number), and edit the comment on the same line:

else if (colour == 6) //white
{
	SetupSword(150,0.0,0.0);
	SetupSwordModel("rapier_w_wh","rapier_h_wh","icn_es_wh");
}
else if (colour == 7) //aquamarine
{
	SetupSword(150,0.0,0.0);
	SetupSwordModel("rapier_w_wh","rapier_h_wh","icn_es_wh");
}

Then, replace the last 2 numbers on the SetupSword line with custom hue and saturation values. For example, in the case of Red, the line would change from

SetupSword(150,0.0,0.0);

to

SetupSword(150,0.98,0.9);

The first number (150) should generally not be touched unless you want to increase or decrease the intensity (how far it travels and lights up the environment) for a custom rapier.

After this, on the next line, change the model paths from "rapier_w_wh" to point to the same paths you created earlier. So for example, the line:

SetupSwordModel("rapier_w_wh","rapier_h_wh","icn_es_wh");

would become

SetupSwordModel("rapier_w_aq","rapier_h_aq","icn_es_aq");

The code should look similar to this:

<...more lines...>
else if (colour == 6) //white
{
	SetupSword(150,0.0,0.0);
	SetupSwordModel("rapier_w_wh","rapier_h_wh","icn_es_wh");
}
else if (colour == 7) //aquamarine
{
	SetupSword(150,0.98,0.9);
	SetupSwordModel("rapier_w_aq","rapier_h_aq","icn_es_aq");
}
else //black
		{
			//Remove Lighting
<...more lines...>

Then save the file.

The new rapier should now be available to all future rapier spawns, although it may require a new game (not sure).
