Coloured Laser Rapiers All-in-One Changelog

v1.04:
- No longer in beta! After thorough testing by multiple people, this is now ready to go!
- Removed print statements that were part of the beta version. This should pollute ss2.log a lot less.
- Slightly modified purple rapier glow to fit the rapier colour better.
- Glow brightness values are now controlled via constants at the top of the script, for easier editing by others.

v1.04 BETA 4:
- Removed Scripted Object replacements to ensure compatibility with both Secmod and SS2-RSD, since the latter replaces and changes objects via script, including rapiers.
    - Took a different approach to ensure rapiers in the maps are replaced.
- Fixed borked Black assassin rapier model

v1.04 BETA 3:
- Added DML edits to recreate all in-map rapiers in the vanilla game and SCP. Not Secmod compatible currently.

v1.04 BETA 2:
- Updated the Assassin Rapier models to use the same textures as the standard ones, rather than an identical copy.
    - The Blue variant now uses the standard BLUE.PCX and TURQ.PCX files from vanilla

v1.04 BETA:
- Completely changed the way assassin rapiers work. It should now be perfectly consistent
    - Assassins will now roll a rapier colour once, and apply it to every rapier they generate, including loot
    - Assassin rapier rarity can now be set the same way that regular rapier rarity can be

v1.03:
- Minor changes to the code for legibility, added more documentation comments in the squirrel file for people who wish to tweak the mod.
- Added Secmod assassin support.
- If assassins are forced to use a rapier colour, it will also affect rapiers they drop on death.

v1.02:
- Slightly brightened the White variant of the texture as it was too dark around the edges, making the rapier look like a thin white stick (world model only).
- Fixed extremely stupid bug introduced in v1.01 involving wrong rapier colours when transitioning levels.
- Updated assassin rapier textures to ensure consistency with the standard ones, including the overly-bright blue texture (caused by GIF palette issues in the Secmod model).
    - Assassin rapiers should now look identical to their standard counterparts
    - Load after Secmod and Scary Monsters, as they both include the same blue assassin rapier model

v1.01:
- Added support for the upcoming v1.03 version of Scary Monsters Assassin Rapiers Addon
    - Assassins will no longer hold rapiers incorrectly
    - Due to the way Scary Monsters works, the assassins generate a new Rapier every time they attack. This means the colours continually change.
        - Added a new setting to combat this, assassinForceColor at the top of the squirrel file.
    - Includes a missing texture bluegrad.gif, which fixes the purple Jorge texture on blue assassin rapiers.
- Fixed issues with level loading corrupting rapier glows (fixed for real in v1.02)
