v1.02:
- Slightly brightened the White variant of the texture as it was too dark around the edges, making the rapier look like a thin white stick (world model only).
- Fixed extremely stupid bug introduced in v1.01 involving wrong rapier colours when transitioning levels.
- Updated assassin rapier textures to ensure consistency with the standard ones, including the overly-bright blue texture (caused by GIF palette issues in the Secmod model).
    - Assassin rapiers should now look identical to their standard counterparts
    - Load after Secmod and Scary Monsters, as they both include the same blue assassin rapier model

v1.01:
- Added support for the upcoming v1.03 version of Scary Monsters Assassin Rapiers Addon
    - Assassins will no longer hold rapiers incorrectly
    - Due to the way Scary Monsters works, the assassins generate a new Rapier every time they attack. This means the colours continually change.
        - Added a new setting to combat this, assassinForceColor at the top of the squirrel file.
    - Includes a missing texture bluegrad.gif, which fixes the purple Jorge texture on blue assassin rapiers.
- Fixed issues with level loading corrupting rapier glows (fixed for real in v1.02)
